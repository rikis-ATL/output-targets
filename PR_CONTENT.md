# feat(angular): Add tree-shaking support with secondary entry points

## What does this PR do?

This PR introduces tree-shaking support for Angular components by generating individual component files when using `outputType: 'standalone'`. This enables component-level imports similar to Angular Material, significantly reducing bundle sizes for applications that use only a subset of components.

## What is the current behavior?

Currently, the Angular output target generates a single bulk file containing all component proxies. When any component is imported, the entire component library is included in the bundle, even if only one component is used.

## What is the new behavior?

When `outputType: 'standalone'` is configured, the output target now generates:
- Individual component files for optimal tree-shaking
- Backward-compatible bulk export file
- Proper TypeScript interface declarations for component accessibility

**Usage Examples:**
```ts
// Tree-shakable: only imports specific components
import { MyButton } from 'my-angular-lib/components/my-button';

// Bulk import: imports multiple components (still available)
import { MyButton, MyCard } from 'my-angular-lib/components';

// Traditional: imports entire library (backward compatible)
import { MyButton } from 'my-angular-lib';
```

## Does this introduce a breaking change?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No

All existing import patterns continue to work. The feature is opt-in via `outputType: 'standalone'`.

## Changes Made

**Core Implementation:**
- Simplified configuration by removing redundant `individualComponentExport` flag
- Tree-shaking is now controlled solely by `outputType: 'standalone'`
- Fixed TypeScript interface generation to prevent duplicate identifier conflicts
- Organized value accessor files in proper `/directives/` structure
- **Follows Angular Material's secondary entry point pattern** for optimal tree-shaking

**Angular Material Approach:**
This implementation mirrors Angular Material's proven tree-shaking strategy:
- Individual component modules (e.g., `@angular/material/button`, `@angular/material/card`)
- Secondary entry points enable precise imports without loading the entire library
- Maintains backward compatibility with bulk imports from the main package
- Leverages Angular's built-in tree-shaking capabilities through standalone components

**Documentation:**
- Added concise tree-shaking documentation to README.md
- Included configuration examples and usage patterns
- Documented backward compatibility guarantees
- Removed empty/unnecessary files (`example-stencil.config.ts`)

**Bundle Size Impact:**
- Potential 60-90% reduction in component library bundle size
- Only imported components and their dependencies are included
- Zero impact on existing projects (backward compatible)

## Testing

- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] E2E tests pass  
- [x] Angular library builds successfully
- [x] Generated components have proper TypeScript accessibility
- [x] Backward compatibility verified with existing bulk exports
- [x] Build pipeline completes without errors

## Configuration Example

To enable tree-shaking, set `outputType` to `"standalone"` and ensure you have a `dist-custom-elements` output target:

```ts
import { Config } from '@stencil/core';
import { angularOutputTarget } from '@stencil/angular-output-target';

export const config: Config = {
  namespace: 'my-components',
  outputTargets: [
    // Required for tree-shaking
    {
      type: 'dist-custom-elements',
      customElementsExportBehavior: 'single-export-module'
    },
    angularOutputTarget({
      componentCorePackage: 'my-component-library',
      directivesProxyFile: '../my-angular-lib/src/directives/proxies.ts',
      outputType: 'standalone' // Enables tree-shaking
    })
  ]
};
```

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `packages/angular/src/types.ts` - Removed redundant `individualComponentExport` property
- `packages/angular/src/output-angular.ts` - Updated logic to use `outputType` instead of removed flag
- `packages/angular/src/generate-angular-component.ts` - Fixed TypeScript interface generation
- `packages/angular/src/generate-individual-components.ts` - Updated configuration checks
- `packages/angular/src/generate-secondary-entry-points.ts` - Updated configuration checks  
- `packages/angular/src/plugin.ts` - Updated configuration checks
- `packages/angular/README.md` - Added tree-shaking documentation

**Removed:**
- `packages/angular/example-stencil.config.ts` - Empty file, no longer needed

**File Organization:**
- Moved value accessor files to proper `/directives/` structure
- Updated import paths in `public-api.ts` to match new organization
